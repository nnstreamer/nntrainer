# CustomShortcut

![DemoFootage](/docs/images/customshortcut.webp)

`CustomShortcut` is a nntrainer demo app that maps user defined symbol to smily face or sad face.

For example, user can draw `^^` few times to train a model to label the drawing as ðŸ˜Š.

Built and tested at `tizen studio 3.7` with `wearable-6.0 profile`

tested on `SM-R800` (it should run in other wearable but it is not guaranteed)

## How to Build and Run

You can use `tizen studio gui` to build and run.

If you want to do in CLI, you first need to [convert the project to CLI](https://developer.tizen.org/ko/development/tizen-studio/native-tools/cli/converting-projects-cli) and do as follows.


### Prerequisite

- [NNTrainer Prerequisite](https://github.com/nnstreamer/nntrainer#prerequisites)
- tizen studio 3.7
- wearable 6.0 rootstrap (built after Aug 25 2020)
- appropriate wearable tizen device with tizen 6.0 installed (built after Aug 25 2020)
- gstreamer plugin png image decoder (https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/png/pngdec.html?gi-language=c)

### Install `pngdec`

Currently, `pngdec` gstreamer element is required but it is not packaged by default in the released wearable OS.

$ sdb shell rpm -Uvh --force --nodeps /tmp_repos/${downloaded_rpm}
```

### Install Newest nntrainer to the device

```bash
$ gbs build --arch armv7l
$ sdb devices
List of devices attached
#device list
$ sdb root on
$ sdb shell "mount -o remount,rw /"
$ sdb push ${gbs repo directory} /tmp_repos/
$ sdb shell rpm -Uvh --force --nodeps /tmp_repos/*.rpm
```

### Build tpk of nntrainer

```bash
$ echo $(pwd)
/data/nntrainer/Applications/Tizen_native/CustomShortcut/
$ tizen build-native -a x86 -C Debug
# ...
$ tizen package -t tpk -- $(pwd)/Debug
