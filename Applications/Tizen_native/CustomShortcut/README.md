# CustomShortcut (tentative)

`CustomShortcut` is a nntrainer demo app that maps user defined symbol to any custom character by on-device training.

For example, user can draw `^^` few times to train a model to label the drawing as ðŸ˜Š.

Built and tested at `tizen studio 3.7` with `wearable-6.0 profile`

tested on `SM-R800` (it should run in other wearable but it is not guaranteed)

## How to Build and Run

You can use `tizen studio gui` to build and run.

If you want to do in CLI, you first need to [convert the project to CLI](https://developer.tizen.org/ko/development/tizen-studio/native-tools/cli/converting-projects-cli) and do as follows.

for the time being, you have to install and prepare nntrainer, capi-nntrainer to run this program

```bash
$ gbs build --arch armv7l
$ sdb devices
List of devices attached
#device list
$ sdb root on
$ pushd ${gbs repo directory}
$ sdb push nntrainer.0.0.1-0.armv7l.rpm /usr
$ sdb push capi-nntrainer.0.0.1-0.armv7l.rpm /usr
$ popd
$ sdb shell
sh-3.2# mount -o remount,rw /
sh-3.2# cd /usr
sh-3.2# rpm -e nntrainer
sh-3.2# rpm -i nntrainer.0.0.1.-0.armv7l.rpm
sh-3.2# rpm -i capi-nntrainer.0.0.1.-0.armv7l.rpm
```

```bash
$ echo $(pwd)
