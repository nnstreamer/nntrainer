# Applications

#### [Custom Shortcut Application](https://github.com/nnstreamer/nntrainer/tree/main/Applications/Tizen_native/CustomShortcut)

A demo application which enable user defined custom shortcut on galaxy watch.

#### [MNIST Example](https://github.com/nnstreamer/nntrainer/tree/main/Applications/MNIST)

An example to train mnist dataset. It consists two convolution 2d layer, 2 pooling 2d layer, flatten layer and fully connected layer.

#### [Reinforcement Learning Example](https://github.com/nnstreamer/nntrainer/tree/main/Applications/ReinforcementLearning/DeepQ)

A reinforcement learning example with cartpole game. It is using DeepQ algorithm.

#### [Transfer Learning Examples](https://github.com/nnstreamer/nntrainer/tree/main/Applications/TransferLearning)

Transfer learning examples with for image classification using the Cifar 10 dataset and for OCR. TFlite is used for feature extractor and modify last layer (fully connected layer) of network.

#### [ResNet Example](https://github.com/nnstreamer/nntrainer/tree/main/Applications/Resnet)

An example to train resnet18 network.

#### [VGG Example](https://github.com/nnstreamer/nntrainer/tree/main/Applications/VGG)

An example to train vgg16 network.

#### [ProductRating Example](https://github.com/nnstreamer/nntrainer/tree/main/Applications/ProductRatings)

This application contains a simple embedding-based model that predicts ratings given a user and a product.

#### [SimpleShot Example](https://github.com/nnstreamer/nntrainer/tree/main/Applications/SimpleShot)

An example to demonstrate few-shot learning : SimpleShot

#### [Custom Example](https://github.com/nnstreamer/nntrainer/tree/main/Applications/Custom)

An example to demonstrate how to create custom layers, optimizers or other supported objects.

<!-- #### Tizen CAPI Example -->

<!-- An example to demonstrate c api for Tizen. It is same transfer learing but written with tizen c api.~ -->
<!-- Deleted instead moved to a [test](https://github.com/nnstreamer/nntrainer/blob/master/test/tizen_capi/unittest_tizen_capi.cpp) -->

#### [KNN Example](https://github.com/nnstreamer/nntrainer/tree/main/Applications/KNN)

A transfer learning example with for image classification using the Cifar 10 dataset. TFlite is used for feature extractor and compared with KNN.

#### [Logistic Regression Example](https://github.com/nnstreamer/nntrainer/tree/main/Applications/LogisticRegression)

A logistic regression example using NNTrainer.

#### [Alexnet Example](https://github.com/nnstreamer/nntrainer/tree/main/Applications/AlexNet)

An example to train Alexnet(Fused) network with CIFAR100 Dataset
