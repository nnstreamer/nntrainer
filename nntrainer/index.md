    <h1>NNTrainer: Software Framework for training Neural Network models on devices.</h1>
    <p>
NNTrainer is an Open Source Project. The aim of the NNtrainer is to develop a Software Framework to train neural network models on embedded devices which have relatively limited resources.

Rather than training whole layers of a network, NNtrainer trains only one or a few layers of the layers added after a feature extractor.
