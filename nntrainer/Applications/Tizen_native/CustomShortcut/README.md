`CustomShortcut` is a nntrainer demo app that maps user defined symbol to smily face or sad face.

For example, user can draw `^^` few times to train a model to label the drawing as ðŸ˜Š.

Built and tested at `tizen studio 3.7` with `wearable-6.0 profile`

tested on `SM-R800` (it should run on other wearable but it has not been verified)

## How to Build and Run

You can use `tizen studio gui` to build and run.

If you want to do in CLI, you first need to [convert the project to CLI](https://developer.tizen.org/ko/development/tizen-studio/native-tools/cli/converting-projects-cli) and do as follows.


### Prerequisite

- [NNTrainer Prerequisite](https://github.com/nnstreamer/nntrainer#prerequisites)
- tizen studio 3.7 with build environment set (eg. certificates)
- wearable 6.0 rootstrap (built after Oct 08 2020)
- appropriate wearable tizen device with tizen 6.0 installed (built after Oct 08 2020)
